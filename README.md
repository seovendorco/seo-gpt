Use AI to automatically create SEO titles and meta descriptions for Yoast SEO, All-in-One SEO, or Simple SEO.

== Description ==

This plugin adds SEO GPT technology to Yoast SEO, All-in-One SEO, and Simple SEO, in order to automatically create title and meta descriptions for pages and blog posts.

SEO GPT works like a virtual SEO assistant, checking the page content, your keyword(s) and brand to write the optimal title and meta description for each page.

Easy to use, once installed, SEO GPT will be available in a page or a post to automatically fill in the title and meta description fields in popular SEO plugins.

The plugins requires an API KEY, which you can get with a free account from the [SEO GPT page](https://seovendor.co/seo-gpt).
